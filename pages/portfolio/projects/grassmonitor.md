An agriculture monitoring system that displayed humidity, temperature, and luminosity of many different areas of a greenhouse. If any sensor reading was not what it was supposed to be, a notification was sent to the user's smart phone.

Created a system to manage data for new greenhouses and areas within the greenhouses.

Sensors were bluetooth and the software was created so that they could be connected to a raspberry pi via web or mobile app.

Implemented automated deployment across an entire fleet of raspberry pi's using third party tools.

Deployed an open source administration app to administer user data.

Included software on: embedded hardware, a cloud server, and a web, iOS and Android app. Meteor was leveraged to create a one in the same, web and mobile app.

Collaborated with my client to create high quality specifications using examples and user stories, and then documented the specifications with automated tests.
