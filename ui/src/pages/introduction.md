Hello. I'm Daniel.

I've been passionately developing software for the past six years. I can help make your web or mobile software project awesome. My tools of choice are **React.js** and **React Native** for the front end, and **Node.js** for the back end. I use AWS as a cloud provider and I am an _AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate_. Please see [my portfolio](/portfolio/) for past projects I have done.

Of all the lessons I've learned over the years, there is one that stands above the rest... Well designed software adheres to the **Cool Software Standard.** It must:

- Be used by many people.
- It must "fit" a need very well.

In order for software to become cool there are MANY things that need to be done, but a few of the most important are:

- Design with constant feedback from users.
- Deliver superior value at minimal cost.
- Cultivate trust with users through good marketing, user experience, support and security practices.
- Be performant.
- Reduce the onboarding cost of new developers through easy to read and well documented code.
- Develop as inexpensively as possible BUT, users must either never notice, or not care when they do.
- Grow with a set of automated tests that verify functionality on all levels of the code and user interface.
- Deploy cloud applications to an infrastructure that is cost optimized.


I strive to bring these principles into every project I work on.
