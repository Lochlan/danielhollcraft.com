### Back-End Development
I've been working with Node.js since before version one. I'm intimately familiar with the eco-system, and the building, testing and maintaining of large applications. I can help you build your node app fast. I also have integrated my solutions using Amazon Web Services Lambda so I can deploy your API with ease to AWS Lambda and build you a back-end that is highly scalable, easy to maintain, and for most cases, free to host.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Architect

As a [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/), I can help you leverage AWS to:

- Create and automate the deployment of solutions based on best practices. 
- Craft solutions that are as efficient and inexpensive as possible.
- Migrate you from an expensive architecture to a much more affordable one.
- Leverage the new [Serverless paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) and allow you to pay based on use instead of by per-hour.
