Created my personal website using the Gatsby static website builder framework. With Gatsby you can create documentation sites, blogs, and community sites fast and without the need of a database.

I hosted the site on Amazon Web Services S3 and use some Amazon Web Services lambda functions to do a few house keeping operations. The result is ridiculously fast, highly scalable website, for a really low price.
